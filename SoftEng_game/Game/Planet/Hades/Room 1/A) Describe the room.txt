Welcome to planet Hades

You walk out of the ship to see a perpetual fog and darkness. 
The roar of a monster echos throughout your location. 
However, you do see a faint light coming from the north that might be coming from an artificial source,
you predict that the light is coming from a resident of this planet. 
You look west and instant you feel the engulfing darkness that might swallow you whole. 
Looking south you feel like theirs something over there. 
To the east, you hearing an absolutely terrifying roar.
